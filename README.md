# PosePal

**PosePal** is a smart, gesture-controlled camera that waits for you. 
Unlike traditional timers that panic you into position, PosePal uses Computer Vision to detect when you are ready.

> *Currently supports: Peace Sign detection (Auto-Snap)*

## Features
* **Readiness Detection:** The camera waits until you hold a specific pose.
* **Smart Countdown:** Visual "Loading Circle" timer prevents accidental snaps.
* **Clean Capture:** Automatically saves the raw photo without UI overlays.
* **Privacy First:** Runs 100% locally on your machine using Python.

## How to Run
1. **Install dependencies:**
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
